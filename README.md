## Simple Python Calculator (Practice project)
This is a small Python project mainly for practice, in which I create a calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations. It is a part of our Python for Beginner Challenge held by the Mentor and Supporters of the Self-study Data Discord community, with support from Sir Alex Freberg (CEO of Analyst Builder).

**The requirements for this project are as follows:**  
- 1 bonus point: Successfully create an input-output for the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 2 bonus points: Add the modulo (%) operation.
- 3 bonus points: Allow inputting calculations with 3 or more number pairs, e.g., aa + bb + cc.
- 4 bonus points: Group operations together, e.g., (A+b) x c.
- 5 bonus points: Include all the above bonus requirements and add continuous calculation functionality, e.g., A + B = AB, AB + C = ABC.
